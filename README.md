# algorithm tasks 
1)    Implement Prim’s Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted graph (network) and the cost of this MST.

In this project assignment, you will use prim’s algorithm, Graphs, Data Structure to write a program for implementing Prim’s Algorithm to understand how Prim’s algorithm could be applied to find MST and to compute its cost.

The Input: a graph (network): G(V, E) and the edges’ weights

The Output: The MST and the cost of the MST

 

2)    Implement Insertion Sort and Merge Sort to sort a list of n numbers.

The Input: a set of n unsorted numbers: a1, a2, a3, . . . , an

The Output: the same given n input number but sorted in increasing way.
